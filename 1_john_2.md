#### Study on First John Chapter 2
The theme of this book: 
* Fellowship with God
  * > 1 John 1:3-4: That which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you, so that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. And we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete.
* Fellowship with each other

How does John accomplish this?: 
* Reassure Christians in their faith
* Counter false teaching 
* Answer the question "What does it mean to be a believer?"
* Offer a series of tests we can use as a mirror

## Sin Hindrances our Fellowship with God
> My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. 2 He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.
* It is clear that sin is a fact in the Christian life
  * > 1 John 1:8  If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.

There is always forgiveness for sin confessed: 
  * > 1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

* > 1 John 1:6  If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:

* God's desire for the believer is that we may not sin. The resources needed for spiritual victory are in Jesus Christ. 
* Sin comes when we rely on our flesh instead of Jesus for victory over sin. One day we will have spiritual victory over sin. 
* John is focusing on this because sin breaks our fellowship.

> And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the whole world.

* **Advocate** A human defense lawyer argues for the innocence of his client. But our Advocate, Jesus Christ, admits our guilt- and then enters His plea on our behalf, as the one who has made an atoning sacrifice for our sinful guilt.

* Why 'The righteous? 
  * Emphasizes that Jesus was fully qualified to serve as our advocate. 

* Propitiation: (act of propitiating)
  * the action of propitiating or appeasing a god, spirit, or person.
  * atonement, especially that of Jesus Christ.
  * **Atonement**: the reconciliation of God and humankind through Jesus Christ.
  * **Reconciliation**: the restoration of a friendly relationship.
  * **Propitiation summary**: This means that Jesus is the one who atones for and takes away not only our sins, but the sins of the whole world. 


## The **Moral** Test:  Has my life changed? 
> 3: Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. He who says, "I know Him," and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him. He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked.

### What is our attitude toward sin? 
  * 'Know' means to know in person here. It implies relationship  
  * Contradiction at first glance: There are different interpretations...
  * We can't be sinless, but we can sin less.
    * This also doesn't necessarily mean habitual sins 
    * Habitual sin is serious, but the real problem is our attitude toward sin. Have we been made new?
  * 'Keep' translates from a word to carefully guard and **treasure**
  * **If we aren't dissatisfied or distressed by sin, we don't know him**
    * Do you feel guilt when you sin or are you complacent?
    * Do you look back on memories of sin in a positive way?
    * Do you 'write off' some sins that you have deemed harmless?
    * Do you plan to sin? 
    * **Examples**
  * Is our goal to be sinless, or not to sin very much?  
    * What if an archer's goal was to 'get kind of close to the bulls eye'?
    * What if a soldiers goal was to 'not get shot, very much'
    > “John Newton: I am not what I ought to be, I am not what I want to be, I am not what I hope to be in another world; but still I am not what I once used to be, and by the grace of God I am what I am” 
    * In this life, we won't always hit the bulls eye, but that doesn't mean we don't need to aim for it.


### Is this legalism? No, it's love.
  * > Luke 18 parable
  * > John 14:15 If you love me, keep my commands.
  * > John 15:10 If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commands and remain in his love.


## The **Relational** test: 
----
> 7 Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard. 8 Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and in you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining.
9 Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates a brother or sister[b] is still in the darkness. 10 Anyone who loves their brother and sister[c] lives in the light, and there is nothing in them to make them stumble. 11 But anyone who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness. They do not know where they are going, because the darkness has blinded them.

### The Essence of Love
* This section is addressed to: adelphos  (Brethren, Friends, Beloved)
  * The word really means "Those who are loved"
  * Brethren, Friends, **Beloved** (ESV)

* We should be filled with love because:
  * We are commanded to
  * As believers, we are filled with God's love. 
  * God first reveled his love to us

* This is an old commandment
  * > Deuteronomy 6:5: Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.
  * > Leviticus 19:18 Love your neighbor as yourself, I am the LORD. (funny end)

* This is a new commandment because we now have Jesus
> 8 Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and in you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining.

> Romans 5:6-8 For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. For one will scarcely die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die— but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
* We have experienced the love of Jesus 
* We are now filled with the love of Jesus. He is the ultimate example
* It is our responsibility to Imitate him
> Ephesians 5:1-2: Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children; 2 and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.

* Read 1 Corinthians 13:1-13
> 1 Corinthians 13:  If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal

* Our relationships should be evidence of our relationship with God 
* This test is simple: Do we love one another?

This may seem easy, but what does that actually look like?
* I 'love' hanging out with friends. Not exactly the love of Jesus
* Love should be sacrificial, and Jesus love was un-deserved

## Are you Spiritually growing
**Children**: 
  * People who have experienced forgiveness of sins
    * This is not age, but spiritual maturity
    * > Children of christ verse
    * Forgiveness is first experience
    * Not because we 'feel, deserve' forgiveness, but 'For his names sake'
    * This is not the end of the journey...
    * In **verse 12**, 'Children' implies born as a descendant
    * In **verse 14**, 'Children' implies infant, immature, suckling
      * Under care of teachers
      * Constantly growing
      * Kids don't know much, but they finds comfort in Mom and Dad
      * Lack discernment
      * What helps Children grow? Food. (The bible important)
      > 1 Peter 2: Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation
      * So many Christians have stunted growth

**Young Men**:
* Are you a pushover? 
* Do you constantly consent to sin? 
* Paying attention to God's word and what it says about sin
* The word of god 'Abides' in you. 
  * You are going to approach situations with scripture
* Mature Christians are bible literate
* Do you love the Bible?
* Overcome the devil, success over sin the wicked one


**Fathers**:
* People who are mature in their faith. 
* I have known Jesus for a long time, and I know what the Bible says about Jesus
* Some people have been a Christian for a long time, but now very little about Jesus
> Philipians 3:10 I want to know Christ—yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,
* What did Paul want? To understand and comprehend who Jesus is more.
* What's unique about a father? Capable of Reproduction by pointing others through Christ
* > 1 Corinthians 4:14-16 I am writing this not to shame you but to warn you as my dear children. 15 Even if you had ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel. 16 Therefore I urge you to imitate me.
* A good parent confronts the child when he is at risk
* The spiritually mature **Warn people about the truth**

> You are writing a gospel, a chapter each day,
by deeds that you do, by the words that you say.
Men read what you write, whether faithless or true.
Say, what is the gospel according to you?

> You are writing each day a letter to men;
take care that the writing is true,
‘Tis the only gospel some men will read,
the gospel according to you.

  

  
Questions:
1. Moral test: Has my life changed? Am I disgusted with sin?
