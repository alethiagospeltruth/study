>6 When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. 7 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.

## The Fall
This passage is often mislabeled as a **myth** or **legend**, but the Bible records this as a **real** event. 

We are introduced to:
* Evil
* Sin
* Satan
* Shame
* Punishment 
* Mercy 

This chapter marks a decisive **turning point** in the history of the universe. Chapter 2 ends with Gods perfect creation, but here we are introduced to mans sinful nature. `movie`

The real tragedy is not that we have to labor or that women have difficulty during childbirth, but that sin crippled our ability to have perfect communion with God.

TODO: there is a lot to learn here.

### The temptation
>1 Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden’?”
2 The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, 3 but God did say, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.’”
4 “You will not certainly die,” the serpent said to the woman. 5 “For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”

#### Satan Lays a foundation
> Now the **serpent**

The true identity of the serpent isn't clear here, it is confirmed later the bible that this is Satan appearing as a pre-curse serpent. 
>  said to the woman

Eve had not received the command directly from God, so she was a more vulnerable target. 

It is also possible that Satan noticed that **Adam did not clearly communicate** the command from Eve. 

Satan always attacks the weakest link at an **opportune** moment. `temptation to sin` `chris`

> “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden’?”

Satan twists the command of God to use it as a weapon.  
`jesus tempted in the desert`

#### Eve's weakness

>3 but God did say, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree **that is in the middle** of the garden, **and you must not touch it, or you will die.**'

There are three critical mistakes in this statement:
* She **responds** to Satan.
  * The ONLY way to respond to Satan's temptation is with scripture.
* She lacks **confidence** about what God said. She is uncertain of the tree. She doesn't know the name of it, just that it's 'in the middle'
* She **adds** to what God said. 

#### Satan's Lie

>4 “You will not certainly die,” the serpent said to the woman. 5 “For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”

Todo: word for 'Know' since it really means experience
common misinterpretation 

Satan's attack uses several strategies:
* Make sin appear attractive
* Make God appear evil, since he doesn't want us to sin
* Infuse truths with lies

Becoming 'Like God' is the same trap Satan fell into. 

#### Sin
> 6 When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.

Eve fell to the same temptation that is described by John in 1 John 2:16
> 16 For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world.

This is also the same sin we struggle with today.

Eve did not have to take the fruit. It was her own doing.

`1 Corinthians 10:13`
> 13 No temptation[a] has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted[b] beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted,[c] he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.

Eve became an agent of temptation for Adam, but Atom received the command directly from God. It wasn't tricked, he ate it out of defiance. This is why the fall of man is placed on Atom. 


> 7 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.>

One of the saddest verse in all of scripture
Todo: fill in here from YouTube video

Fig leaves are course and prickly. Any time we try to hide our sin from God it is foolishness.

>8 Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the Lord God among the trees of the garden.

It's amazing to think that they had such Physical interaction with God. 'Walking' 

>9 But the Lord God called to the man, “Where are you?”
10 He answered, “I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.”

Sin always drives us away from God. 


> 11 And he said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”

Whenever God asks a question, it is for our benefit. This was an opportunity for Adam to repent.

> 2 The man said, “The woman you put here with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”

Adam blames both Eve and God

> 13 Then the Lord God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”
